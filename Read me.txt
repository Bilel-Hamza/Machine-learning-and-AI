The problem: Our algorithm that solves the salesman problem using ACO "Ant Colony Optimization".
We want to optimize the algorithm. 

The project is about finding the best parameters

- The folder "code" contains the original code
- The folder "updated code" contains the original code with some changes:
	-  Implementing the elitist ant algorithm
	-  Using the data2 

- The folder references contains some references we read during our research
- the  MNIST CNN optimized with ACO notebook contains our try to optimize the number of layers in CNN using the ACO which is important to make the model more performant 
- The "ACO version 2" is a presentation with all the tables
- The "ACO version 1" is a presentation without the tables
